Analyzing the Impact of Global Macroeconomic Indicators on Emerging Market Sovereign Bonds

--Emerging Market Sovereign Bonds and Macroeconomic Indicators

Desc - A data-driven analysis of how global macroeconomic indicators impact the behavior of sovereign bond yields in emerging markets.

--- Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between global macroeconomic indicators (such as interest rates, inflation, oil prices, US yields, and geopolitical shocks) and the sovereign bond yields of selected emerging market countries.

The goal is to:
- Identify how different indicators affect bond performance.
- Understand country-specific vulnerabilities and patterns.
- Visualize these relationships using meaningful plots.

--- Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, yfinance)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git & GitHub
